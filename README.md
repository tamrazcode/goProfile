## ‚ö†Ô∏è A Small Note from the Author

I'm fairly new to creating Minecraft plugins, but at some point, I needed a plugin with similar functionality and couldn't find a good one in the open-source community, so I decided to make my own. I hope you enjoy using **goProfile**! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I also inform you that Grok AI was used to create the plugin - thank you bro.
